You are listening to a famous song. [x]

You think of the summer when you travelled the country with your family. []
You were really happy back then. []

But time passes. [x]

Imagine you are sitting in the garden. Your best friend is no longer with you. [x]
You can hear kids playing outside. []

For some reason, it reminds you of a painting. [x]

It's very tasteful. [x]

You think of your other trips and adventures.
They were not really that happy again, were they.

Maybe we should have stopped them sooner.
Maybe the mountains would be a happier place without some sorts of people.

But everything is fine now.
We can move on.

# Sample 2

Imagine you are sitting on a sofa. You are spending time with your cousin.
An old clock is ticking nearby.

[still: /res/stills/nos/79_0.jpg]

You are reading an acclaimed book.
It is about a great journey of a shy man and a bit unconventional.

[still: /res/stills/nos/84_1.jpg]

You suddenly remember the third time you were in love.
The feeling warms you up. Love is beautiful.

[still: /res/stills/sealedintime/tumblr_poggo6F4Sc1y62e4co1_640.jpg]

But life goes on.

Imagine you are sitting on a sofa. Your cousin has moved far away.
A thunderstorm is coming.

[still: /res/stills/slideofthetimes/tumblr_pg606cAFx61x4cwtgo1_1280.jpg]

You are watching a crime movie.
It is about a woman and hate. Inspirational.

[still: /res/stills/coolkidsofhistory/tumblr_op1faat9DE1w8i449o1_1280]

At one point in the movie, a talkshow plays in the background.
An outgoing attorney talks with the host.
They are passionately discussing society and purpose.

[still: /res/stills/nos/75_8.jpg]

You remember your third love again. Was it ever the same?
Things got sadder and sadder. So sad.

But now we are in better place.
You can move on.
