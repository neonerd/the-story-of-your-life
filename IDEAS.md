# CONCEPTS OF STRUCTURE

The work itself is 3 structures nested inside each other and self-referencing:

* 1. The fictional roleplaying excercise environment and software.
* 2. The meta-narrative act structure.
* 3. The fictional roleplaying narrative structure.

We should first generate the basic structure - the narrative units and what are they trying to achieve.

## Meta-narrative structure

### Exposition:
- Countdown
- Intro, always stays the same

Lasts countdown + 30 seconds? -> 30 SEC

### Confrontation
- Slowly introducing the imagine concept, using more complex devices later on
- Should last around X narrative units, where each narrative unit lasts 3-4 subtitles (20-30 seconds?)
- Visuals start out as Americana nostalgia

5 narrative units * 30 seconds -> 150 SEC

### Resolution
- Roleplaying generator should start to fail / distrub the sequence
- Visuals should be replaced by fancy instagram pictures -> Life wasn't fun only in the 60's (?)
- The opposing audio should be done using different voice

## Narrative structure (carried by narrative units)

NarrativeSequence consisting of 5-7 narrative units. (number may be changed later based on flow and rythm of the piece)




















# CONCEPTS OF STORYTELLING

## Chaining

linear: nested
linear: unnested
linear: parallel

linear: serial
* weak (connected with previous narrative unit superficially)
* strong (connected with previous narrative unit by some strong bond)

non-linear: flashbacks
non-linear: flashforwards
non-linear: mind





## Transitions

They need to happen between narrative units.
Should be quick.

"At one point, you can hear a song in the background."
"The article mentions a movie".
"In one the levels, you can read magazine."




# CONCEPTS OF WRITING

simple vs. complex
do we really need the complex framing of the topics?

Gertrude Stein:
"For example, characters are not sweet or sad or angry, they have sweetness in them, are sad ones, or have angry feeling."

Try to make descriptions of media descriptive, not only a narrative.

Writing generative text by trying to appropiate existing examples (how was this originally called somwhere on Twitter?):

"Imagine you are in your room. Someone you love is next to you."

"And one of the men is evil and the other one is good. Or so do we think."


literary elements:

* repetition
* aliteration
* pauses and other forms of rythm breaking

certainity of phrases (certainity: 0 - 1)


every new narrative unit begins with "Imagine..."

# INTRO

Countdown from 60 to 0.
