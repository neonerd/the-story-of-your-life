In 1975 I saw a girl outside my first class at college in Redding, Ca. I was smitten! 
We started dating, we listened to this song. We thought about what life would be like as we aged together. 
We've been married over 42 years now. We raised six children, one passed away two years ago. She moves a little slower now, but I love her as I did then. 
This song takes me back to her when she was young and we were just starting out...
